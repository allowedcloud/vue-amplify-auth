Example application featuring user authentication backed by AWS Amplify, built with Vue 3 + new [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html).
I've made this as part of my exploration using Vue and Amplify together. It is an on-going work in progress and thus **not fit for production** just yet. The end goal is to create something simple and straightforward enough that it can be used as a guide to others. Eventually creating a starter template and/or plugin. Check out the demo below and create an account to see how it works!
