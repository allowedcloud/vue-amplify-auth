### [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), using [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse) starter template, [Pinia](https://pinia.esm.dev/) for state, [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) for user authentication

Demo application showing user authentication backed by AWS Amplify built with Vue 3 + new [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html).
Having created the same thing but with Vue 2,
I built this in an effort to explore Vue 3.
That being so, it is **not** production-ready.

I will continue to optimize things as I become more familiar with all that Vue 3 has to offer. 
The end goal being to create a starter template or stand alone plugin that can be incorporated into any Vue 3 application wanting user authentication with AWS Amplify.
