Example application featuring user authentication backed by AWS Amplify, built with Vue 3 + new [Composition API](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html).
Having created the same thing but with Vue 2,
I built this in an effort to explore Vue 3.
That being so, it is **not** production-ready.

I will continue to optimize things as I become more familiar with Vue 3. 
The end goal being to create a starter template or plugin that can be incorporated into any Vue 3 application wanting user authentication with AWS Amplify.
